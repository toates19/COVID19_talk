Covid19 talk
I gave this talk to a webinar on covid-19 hosted by Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences in Iran. 

It doesn't have anything groundbreaking in it but might be useful to you. However, please note that absolutely none of it is medical advice from me, or representative of the views of my employer. It is meant as educational material only.
